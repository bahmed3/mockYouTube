# Mock YouTube Page
This is a project where I recreated a YouTube homepage as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of HTML and CSS. 

## Objective 
The objective of this project was to replicate the structure and design of a YouTube page to enhance my understanding of how HTML and CSS can be used to create complex layouts.

## Technologies 
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Strategy
Here are the key strategies I employed:

### HTML
- **Semantic HTML:** I made use of semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc. for better readability and SEO optimization.
- **Embedded Media:** I incorporated media on the page using the `<iframe>` element.
- **Navigation Bar:** I created a navigation bar using the `<nav>` element.

### CSS
- **Flexbox:** I utilized the CSS Flexbox layout module for arranging content in a flexible and responsive manner.
- **Grid System:** For certain sections of the page, a grid system was used to achieve the desired layout.
- **Media Queries:** I incorporated media queries for responsiveness, allowing the layout to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **CSS Variables:** I used CSS variables to maintain consistency in the color scheme and spacing.

## Lessons Learned
This project deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS and gave me practical experience in creating a webpage layout from scratch. It also helped me learn the importance of structuring HTML in a semantic manner and using CSS effectively to create a responsive and attractive page.

## Future Work
I plan on improving my skills by learning JavaScript interactivity, which will improve accessibility and optimizing designs fit for better user experiences.
My next project will be more standalone, and I will integrate APIs into my next website, to showcase the growth from this initial project.
